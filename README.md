# directory-tree

The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and convenient implementation of Java Swing JTree model with
a hierarchy of filesystem directories (e.g. for directory chooser component).

This library is packaged as a Java 9 module `org.swingk.io.dirtree` (with a single dependency on a system module `java.desktop`).

This project has no dependencies (except JUnit 5, for testing).

Requires Java 11 or later.
